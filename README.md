Web Programming Exercises Collection

Welcome! I'm Seyed Hamid Hosseini, and this repository contains a collection of web programming exercises that I developed to deepen my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each exercise poses a unique challenge and represents the hands-on learning process I went through to enhance my skills in web development.

Project Overview:

Hafez Divination (Question 1)
In this exercise, I created a simple program that randomly displays a verse from Hafez’s poems. Users can click a button to receive a random poem. This project helped me learn more about event handling and working with random functions in JavaScript.
Key Features:
Random display of Hafez's poems.
Simple and minimalistic design.


Age Calculator (Question 2)
The second exercise focuses on age calculation based on the user's birthdate. This project provided me with a better understanding of working with date and time in JavaScript.
Key Features:
Accurate age calculation based on the user’s input.
User-friendly date input field.


Currency Converter (Question 3)
One of my favorite exercises, this program allows users to input a currency amount and convert it into other currencies such as USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, and AUD. This project gave me the opportunity to work with data handling and table design in HTML and CSS.
Key Features:
Conversion of currencies to USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, and AUD.
Display of conversion rates in a well-organized table.
Online Quiz (Question 4)


This project was inspired by online exams. Users can choose the number of questions they want to answer, and questions are randomly selected from a question bank. Working on this project allowed me to gain experience with randomization and score calculation in JavaScript.
Key Features:
Users can select the number of questions.
Randomly generated quiz with score calculation.


Car Price Estimator (Question 5)
In this project, I developed a program that calculates the estimated price of a car based on details such as the year of manufacture, mileage, number of accidents, and insurance coverage. It was a great opportunity to work with financial formulas and user inputs.
Key Features:
Price estimation based on year, mileage, and accidents.
Insurance and car color influence the final price.


Prayer Times (Question 6)
For this question, I created a program that displays prayer times for the next week based on the user’s selected city. This exercise helped me practice working with time and date functionality in JavaScript, as well as managing location-based data.
Key Features:
Display of prayer times for an entire week.
City-based selection for accurate prayer times.


Blog Post Display (Question 7)
Inspired by content management systems, this project displays a blog post along with information about the author, number of likes, and comments. Users can like the post, bookmark it, or share it.
Key Features:
Display of blog post information, including author details.
Like, bookmark, and share functionalities.
Display of comments related to the post.


Loan Calculator (Question 8)
In this exercise, I created a loan calculator that calculates monthly payments based on the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term. This project gave me great experience in working with financial calculations and mathematical formulas in JavaScript.
Key Features:
Calculates monthly payments based on loan amount, interest rate, and loan term.
Calculates the loan amount based on the user’s desired monthly payment.
