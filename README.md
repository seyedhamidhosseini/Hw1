Web Programming Exercises Collection

Welcome! I'm Seyed Hamid Hosseini, and this repository contains a collection of web programming exercises that I developed to deepen my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each exercise poses a unique challenge and represents the hands-on learning process I went through to enhance my skills in web development.
